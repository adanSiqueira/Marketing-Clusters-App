# User Segmentation Analysis for Marketing with K-means

## Overview

This project uses the **K-means clustering algorithm** to segment users into groups based on their interests, aiming to enhance marketing campaigns. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, we can identify different profiles and create more personalized and effective marketing strategies.

With this model, you can predict which group a user belongs to, enabling more targeted campaigns for segmented audiences. The model was trained based on features such as **gender** and other relevant variables, and it can be easily applied to new data through the Streamlit app interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: To create the interactive user interface.
- **Scikit-learn**: For training and applying the K-means clustering model.
- **Joblib**: To save and load models and transformers (such as `scaler` and `encoder`).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
├── app.py # Main file that contains the Streamlit interface.
├── encoder.pkl # Encoding model for the "gender" variable.
├── modelo_kmeans.pkl # Trained K-means clustering model.
├── novas_entradas.csv # Sample file with new data to be analyzed.
├── requirements.txt # Project dependencies.
├── scaler.pkl # Data scaling transformer.
└── pasta/models/ # Contains scripts for model loading and prediction.
├── init.py
├── load_models.py # Function to load all models and transformers.
├── predict.py # Function to process data and make predictions.
└── Desenvolvimento do modelo.ipynb # Document with the description of model development.
```

## How It Works

### 1. Loading the Models

When the app starts, the following models and transformers are loaded:

- **Encoder**: To encode the categorical "gender" variable.
- **Scaler**: To normalize the data before applying the model.
- **K-means**: The trained K-means clustering model, which segments users into different groups based on their characteristics.

### 2. User Interface

The Streamlit interface allows the user to:

- Upload a CSV file with user data.
- View the description of the groups generated by the model.
- Get clustering predictions for the uploaded data.
- Download the file with the prediction results.

The segmentation is performed into three main groups:

- **Group 0**: Young audience with strong interests in fashion, music, and appearance.
- **Group 1**: Associated with sports and culture.
- **Group 2**: Balanced, with interests in music, dance, and fashion.

### 3. Predicting New Data

The user can upload new data, which will be automatically processed, and the model will predict which group each user belongs to. This is useful for segmenting marketing campaigns, allowing for a more personalized approach.

## How to Run the Project

### Requirements

Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running the Application

Run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Sample CSV File

The `novas_entradas.csv` file contains sample data that can be uploaded to test the model. The file should have at least the gender column (for encoding) and the other variables required for the clustering model.

## Expected Results

The K-means clustering model segments users into three main groups based on the following interests:

- **Group 0**: Focused on fashion, music, and aesthetics.
- **Group 1**: Interests in sports and pop culture.
- **Group 2**: A diverse audience with interests in music, dance, and style.

This segmentation can be used to target more effective marketing campaigns, creating personalized ads focused on the behavior and preferences of each group.
